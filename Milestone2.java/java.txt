Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language that was first released in 1995 by Sun Microsystems.
It is designed to be portable and platform-independent, meaning that code written in Java can run on any platf
-orm that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed, without the need for recompilation.Java is widely used f
-or developing web applications, mobile apps, desktop software, games, and more. One of the main reasons for i
-ts popularity is its scalability and robustness, which make it suitable for building large-scale, complex sys
-tems. Java also has a large and active community of developers, who have created a vast ecosystem of libraries.


Frameworks, and tools that can be used to enhance the language's capabilities. Java is known for its strong type
 checking and safety features, which help to prevent common programming errors such as null pointer exceptions 
and type mismatches. It also has built-in memory management through garbage collection, which frees developers 
from having to manage memory allocation and deallocation manually. Java is a compiled language, which means that 
the source code is compiled into byte code that can be executed on any platform with a JVM.


Than interpreted languages like Python and Ruby, but slower than compiled languages like C++. Java has evolved
over time, with new features and improvements added in each new release. The language is maintained and developed
by Oracle Corporation, who provide support and resources for developers. Java is free and open-source, which makes
it accessible to anyone who wants to learn and use it.
